Static Site Generator
=====================
This static site generator uses Make and Pandoc on Linux to generate a simple static site.

It turns markdown files into HTML. Math formulae in LaTeX are handled, so you can write this kind of thing:

If $a = p^n$ is a prime power then $Ã˜(p^n) = p^n - p^{n - 1}$

Why?
